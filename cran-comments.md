R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.1.1 and R Under development (unstable) (2014-07-20 r66218), Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

Kurt Hornik emailed about duplicate jsonlite entry. That was removed. The dataset `full_sensor_list` is well doucumented in the man files.

Thanks! Karthik Ram

ee_search_obs 1.536  0.012  14.314 on a rather fast machine: the CRAN policies ask for a few seconds." The function in question requests data from a web API. Even the fastest machine cannot ensure a perfect connection every single time and also cannot control for concurrent users. To abide by the 5 second requriement, I have commented out nearly all examples now. Multiple checks in a row all pass under 5 seconds.

Thanks! Karthik Ram
